Bazel is a build tool that builds code quickly and reliably.  It is used to
build the majority of Google's software, and thus it has been designed to
handle build problems present in Google's development environment, including:

* A massive, shared code repository, in which all software is built from
  source.  Bazel has been built for speed, using both caching and parallelism
  to achieve this.  Bazel is critical to Google's ability to continue to scale
  its software development practices as the company grows.

* An emphasis on automated testing and releases.  Bazel has been built for
  correctness and reproducibility, meaning that a build performed on a
  continuous build machine or in a release pipeline will generate
  bitwise-identical outputs to those generated on a developer's machine.

* Language and platform diversity.  Bazel's architecture is general enough to
  support many different programming languages within Google, and can be used
  to build both client and server software targeting multiple architectures
  from the same underlying codebase.
